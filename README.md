# array_Operations_Cpp
Just testing and learning C++ OOP.

## How to edit current project?

First of all, you need to put your workspace (in VSCode) as a folder that contains the project.

*(Example): "C/Projects", and the project would be in a path like "C/Projects/arrayOperations".*

## How to compile?

Move with terminal to project folder (arrayOperations's folder). Then, execute the following (requires g++ compiler):

*g++ -I ./Include arrayOperations.cpp*

  
## How to execute?

When we compile like explained before, "a.exe" file has been created (because we haven't specified -o name).

*Just execute it with ./a.exe*
